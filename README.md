# Joshua Udom | Visual Communications & Design Portfolio

## Project Overview

A high-performance, architecturally sound portfolio website tailored for a professional Graphic Designer. This project demonstrates a robust integration between a modern React frontend and a Headless CMS (Sanity.io), allowing for dynamic content management, real-time updates, and an immersive user experience through sophisticated motion design. 🎨

## Key Features

- **Headless CMS Architecture**: Fully integrated with Sanity.io, utilizing custom schemas for projects, categories, and site settings to ensure decoupled content management.
- **Dynamic Routing & Case Studies**: Implements `react-router-dom` for fluid navigation between project galleries and detailed case studies with unique slugs.
- **Advanced Motion Design**: Leverages Framer Motion and AOS (Animate On Scroll) to provide a premium feel with page transitions and staggered entrance animations.
- **Optimized Media Delivery**: Features lazy loading and image optimization via Sanity's image pipeline to maintain high performance despite image-heavy content.
- **Responsive Masonry Layouts**: A custom-configured masonry grid that adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring the design work remains the focal point on any device.
- **Interactive Lightbox**: Integrated `yet-another-react-lightbox` for full-screen, high-resolution inspection of design assets.

## Usage

The application is designed for both public viewers and administrative content management.

### Public Interaction

1. **Navigating Works**: Users can filter through design categories (Flyer, Church, Social Media) on the main landing page using the custom Tab interface.
2. **Viewing Details**: Clicking on any project card triggers a route change to a detailed project page, where the site fetches specific data (client, year, tools used) and renders PortableText case studies.
3. **Contact System**: The contact section provides direct action links for WhatsApp, Email, and Phone, optimized for conversion.

### Content Management (Sanity Studio)

The project includes a built-in Studio environment located at `/studio`.

- **Project Schema**: Allows the designer to upload images, write rich-text case studies, and toggle "Featured" status.
- **Site Settings**: Centralized management for the designer's profile image, tools list, and professional tagline.
